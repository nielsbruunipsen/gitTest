This is a test instance for trying out git stuff. Go ahead\!
git status, git add <file> and git commit -m '<message>' are some useful commands
git reset HEAD <file> removes file from the staging area# gitTest
Another useful command for gitHub is git remote add origin <https...>
git push -u origin master

Possible process for creating an ER instance:

keep a localcopy and a server copy.
push local to server or pull server to local.
create a tag: er_<date>
clone server version to local place: 
- position yourself in project folder
- clone and rename the repo by this command:
	git clone <http>//> <name>_er
- the above clones and renames the github repo locally

To lock an ER instance:
- go to project folder
- chmod 550 <instance_name>
- got to subfolders
- chmod 550 <folders> (for example */)
- chmod u-w <files> (maybe a for loop or the find command)
- chmod g-w
- chmod o-rwx
- lock files:
	find . -type f -exec chmod u-w {} \;

To delete a gir repo do:
- rm -rf .git
